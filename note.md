Lesson 15.
  1. VERY IMPORTANT Guidance to the external library:
    - before doing a complicated thing, trying to find an external library first instead of writing the codes ourselves.
    - Find it in Google, or via AI tool (Gemini, gpt, etc...)
    - Use type="module" for external library to avoid conflicts (ESM module) . ESM-ecmascript module is basically javascript module.
    - only ESM module used like this, if not, you still gotta put it inside script tags.
    - default export (like in day.js), don't put it inside curly bracket {}. Each file only have 1 default export
